1. 
The time taken for Shortest Path function with 800 vertices trying to find the path from 0 to 799, while normally taking aroud 80 milliseconds, would occassionally pass the threshold. When decreased to 400 vertices and trying to find the path between 0 and 399 consistently took around 21 milliseconds, which is close to 1/4 of the time for the previous test. 


For a random graph, the time at 1000 vertices finding the 0 -> 999 path was around 1 second, with the time at 500 vertices trying to find the 0 -> 499 was around 25 milliseconds, which is close to 1/4 of the time for the previous test.


2.
The random graph took around 1 second for a graph of 100 vertices. When repeated with a graph of half the size, the test took around 17 seconds, which is close to 1/4 of the time.


3.
When using a 100 vertex random graph with an average of 7 adjacent vertices, the result was that the graph usually was not connected. When the adjacent vertices was changed to 20, the graph was far more likely to be connected.


4.
When finding the Multiple Link Disjoint Paths for a type 3 graph, the number of paths was always one less than the number of vertices in the graph, due to all of them being connected.
